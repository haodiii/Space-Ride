NMA-3012-Final – SPACE RIDE

Final Project Documentation

Artist Statement, Summary, and Inspiration:

This piece of project was inspired a paragraph in a book “The Gifts of Imperfections” by Ph.D. Brené Brown. She points out a truth that we, humans, are so easy to get distracted by the others’ behavior. Sometimes plans, opinions and achievements of our friends can, to some degree, affect our mood. We are likely to compare a certain result of ours to our friends’. If we didn’t behave as well as our friends to, then we tend to doubt ourselves and become less confident. However, what really matters is to focus on personal inter-development rather than compared to steps of the others.

The artist uses stars as metaphors of different humans while focuses on displaying their originality. When display the project, the audience will see a greeting word “Welcome to the space ride” in the middle of the screen. The text will shake if you put mouse on it. Then, in the second mode, dots of different blue levels appear randomly indicates the first impression of skies and stars in people’s mind that stars are twinkling all the time. People may feel curious towards the mysterious staff beyond these quite dots.

The third mode mainly focus on the interaction of the mouse. A pour of silver stars falls out continuously from wherever the mouse is located at, and they also follow with the movement with the mouse. Audience can draw anything they want in a short time because stars will fall down quickly after they show up due to gravity and disappear eventually. 

The next scene is a close look of a blue star which spins automatically. It is designed to be the highlight of this space ride because audience can finally observe an individual star’s movement closely and slowly. 

The last scene contains a green eye observing at the top left of the screen represent an eye of audience and its eyeball follows the movement of mouse as well. Below the eye, multiple white stars flow automatically in the main area of the screen. With a mouse click in any area of the screen, the whole movement of the stars shifts to another way, showing that all the stars begin to move to different directions at the same time. 

The combination of these five scenes indicate a process of expressing curiosity towards unknown things, imagination of them, close observation of them and understanding them as a whole. The project wants to indicate that curiosity appears commonly to unknown and unfamiliar things, as for here, like stars. Charming and twinkling stars are shining as some great people around us, but they are not affected by movement of the others, instead, they hold on to their unique moving path, in my view, that’s what we should behave as well. 

Controls: Move mouse to interact. There are five scenes in the project and audience is able to switch to each mode by clicking “1”, “s”, “t”, “a”, “r” in random order.

Process

I first used “1”, “2”, “3”, “4”, “5” as the switch method to among all the modes, then I realize that I want to make it more related to my project theme. So, I changed to the numbers to the spelling of stars which are “s”, “t”, “a”, “r” in the end.

Besides, I also made several detail adjustments after finishing the draft of my project. I coded a scene containing colorful dots shaping into multiple circles and pump up continuously, later I think it is not that relevant to my theme of space though it looks exciting. After remove this scene, I changed the order of modes to make them more consistent. The last scene was initially the first one since it gives an overview of the space. Then, I moved it to the last one because I think it gets more meaningful to play as a role of reviewing back. Besides, the things pump up in the particle function of mode 2 was at first plain white squares. But I want to make the color simple so I change the whites to silver stars and also changed the color of the beginning texts from blue to silver. 

Finally, I want to add a sound to my project to make audience immerse in the environment, so I import a video with background music to allow the sound display throughout the whole process of the project.
